Kata Clean Code
To review all the "smell" of code and what to do.

Exo one :
Legacy code with NO tests !
 "promotion calculator"
The supermarket wants to calculate product discounts. The rules are the following:

If 2 or less products are bought then no discount is offered.
If 3 or up to 10 products are bought then for every 3 products offer one for free.
If over 11 products are bought then apply 50% off the total price.
If negative product raise argument exception !

Lot 2 : If Sunday add a 10% more discount.
